# Instrument

**Help for specific instruments can be found in the subsections below.**

Once inside a time-point, users will see some general information about the candidate across the top of the screen, such as date of birth, sex, visit label, and subproject(cohort).

The blue sidebar panel contains key flags to mark instrument administration and data entry status. It also allows the user to navigate to different pages if the instrument has multiple pages. It may also contain specific flags depending on the instrument. On mobile devices or in narrow browser windows, this sidebar panel is hidden but can be accessed by clicking the list icon in the top left-hand corner.

In the sidebar, the Data Entry status can be set to either `Complete` or `In Progress`. The status cannot be set to `Complete` if the Administration option is not set. If the Data Entry status is `In Progress`, the sidebar will display the option to delete all the instrument data. The sidebar also allows the user to specify the Administration status of the instrument. 

Under the general information about the candidate at the top of the screen, the user can perform data entry for the instrument. Required values are specified with a red asterisk. If these values are not completed, an error message will appear when a user attempts to save the data. 

If the instrument has multiple pages, the user must save the data individually for each page. If the user has navigated to a page that is not the `Top` page of the instrument, they will be unable to alter any status flags in the sidebar.
