While the Data Entry status is `In Progress`, you may see in the sidebar the option to delete all the instrument data which will clear all data in the form. 

Under the general information about the candidate at the top of the screen, the user can perform data entry for the instrument. Required values are specified with a red asterisk. If these values are not completed, an error message will appear when a user attempts to save the data. 

If the instrument has multiple pages, the user must save the data individually for each page. If the user has navigated to a page that is not the `Top` page of the instrument, they will be unable to alter any status flags in the sidebar.
